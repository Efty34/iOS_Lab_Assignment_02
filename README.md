## Description
In the previous iOS lab, we learned how to integrate Firestore with an Xcode app to enable seamless data management. We explored setting up Firebase in the app, adding data to Firestore, and fetching it dynamically. The fetched data was displayed within the app, demonstrating real-time database capabilities. This exercise highlighted Firestore's ease of use for building scalable, cloud-backed iOS applications.
